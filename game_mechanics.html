                <p>When you use your hit marker, I recommend you to do more headshots then aim for the body since you'll get more critical hits on your opponents, which will give you the +1 elimination more easily.

                <h2>CLIP #3 - Aim</h2>
                <p>Crosshair Color: changing your crosshair color to a bright one helps you to see clearly where you are on the map, at all times. Practice aiming from 10-15 minutes a day to get comfortable with how you're aiming. Practice both spamming weapons and weapons that only shoot once. Weapons that spam will require you to track your movement, while weapons that shoot once require you to focus more closely on your object. Always be near cover; a car, a  building, stairs, anything that'll serve as a nice cover from getting shot at. Use higher ground to your advantage; having an upper hand in any shooting game is important, and the opponent can only target a portion of you when they shoot at you, but you can target them all together. Being on higher ground protects you because you're blocked by the surface you're on. (Clips each of my displaying wrongs when trying to get better aim, then the correct way to do it).

                <h2>CLIP #4 - The 3-1 Tactic</h2>
                <p>The 3-1 Tactic will help you a lot when it comes to weapons that are really slow, such as the Hush Puppy, the M-40, and some of the other snipers. All the weapons usually require you to cock them back, and it takes a while and are slow whenever you're in a fight. You can't deal damage quickly enough because the weapons are really slow but what you can do is take the sniper, for example, fire it, then press 3 and then 1 super quickly, which allows you to switch between you gun and knife really quickly. Whenever you go back to the knife and back to the gun the game won't have to play the animation and you can just take another shot right away! It is still delayed by a little bit but it does help you nail a lot of shots a lot faster than usual.

                <h2>CLIP #5 - Knifing </h2>
                <p>Know your hitboxes; a hitbox is essentially where contact and damage can be made. Learning about hitboxing is one of the best to get good or even better at knifing in Arsenal. The best and quickest way to get kills with knifing is by getting your opponent in the back with the knife. Next is positioning and Movement. One of the best ways to practice positioning and movement is to go into hard mode or insane mode. Those modes allow you to run around freely without huge automatic rifles. Last but not least, learn maps and modes. This doesn't apply to just knifing but the game overall. The more you know maps the easier it'd be to kill people, or knife them, because you'd know where they spawn. Knowing the maps will help you get streak kills.
