        <h2>Detailed description of the game:</h2>
        <p><strong>Arsenal</strong> is a fast-paced, multiplayer FPS game within the Roblox platform. The game is heavily inspired by classic FPS titles like Counter-Strike and Overwatch. Players can join servers and engage in intense battles with a wide variety of weapons and unique game modes. Here's a detailed breakdown of the gameplay elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Weapon Arsenal:</strong> One of the standout features of the game is its extensive weapon arsenal. Players start with a basic weapon and can progress to new weapons by earning kills. Weapons range from pistols and shotguns to sniper rifles and rocket launchers. Each weapon has unique characteristics and attributes, making gameplay diverse and exciting.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Modes:</strong> Arsenal offers a variety of game modes, including Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All, and more. There's a special "Gun Rotation" mode where players are given a random weapon with each respawn. The goal is to work through the entire weapon list to secure a victory. The game modes keep the gameplay fresh and challenging.</li>
            <li><strong>Maps:</strong> Arsenal features a selection of maps with different layouts and environments. Maps can range from urban settings to more exotic locales, adding to the diversity of the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Skins/Cosmetics and Other Things Alike:</strong> Players can customize their character's appearance with various skins, hats, and other cosmetics. Some cosmetics are purely for aesthetic purposes, while others may provide minor gameplay benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Progression System:</strong> Arsenal includes a leveling system that allows players to unlock new weapons and cosmetic items as they progress. Players earn experience points (XP) for kills, wins, and various in-game achievements.</li>
            <li><strong>Community and Competitions:</strong> Arsenal has a rich community of players, and it often hosts tournaments and competitions. Competitive play allows players to test their skills against others and earn recognition within the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> The game's developers, ROLVe Community, have a history of providing regular updates to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. These updates can include new weapons, maps, game modes, and cosmetics.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Ratings and ESRB rating:</strong> Roblox as a whole is rated T for Teen. "Arsenal" on Roblox does not have an official ESRB rating because Roblox games are generally not subject to ESRB ratings. The ratings for Roblox show either full 5-star reviews or 1-star reviews (out of 5 stars). Most of the 1-star review community is made up of parents stating that their children are buying Robux without giving permission from them.</p>

        <h2>Specific Strategies</h2>
        <p><strong>Play Defensively:</strong> In modes like Team Deathmatch, sticking with your team and using cover can help you survive longer and contribute to your team's success.</p>
        <p><strong>Flank Opponents:</strong> Surprise your enemies by taking alternative routes and approaching them from unexpected angles.</p>
        <p><strong>Use Grenades:</strong> Many maps have grenade spawn points. Learning how to use grenades effectively can give you a tactical advantage.</p>
        <p><strong>Control High Ground:</strong> In FPS games, high ground can provide better visibility and shooting angles. Try to control elevated positions when possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Bait Enemies:</strong> Sometimes, luring opponents into a trap or exposing themselves can lead to easy kills.</p>
        <p><strong>Stay Mobile:</strong> Avoid staying in one spot for too long, as it makes you an easy target. Keep moving and changing positions.</p>

        <h2>Is it easy or difficult to pick up?</h2>
        <p>Arsenal can be both simple to learn and difficult to master; the basic controls are relatively simple, making it accessible to new players, but as you advance, you'll face more skilled opponents, and the game's fast-paced nature can be challenging for beginners. It may take some time to become proficient, but with practice and dedication, players can improve their skills and enjoy the competitive aspects of the game; additionally, the community tends to be friendly.</p>

                <p>Set your FOV to 103. The Crosshair Color should be any really bright color. Camera Sensitivity should be at 0.68/0.67999 in the regular Settings Menu of a Roblox Gam.

                <h2>CLIP #3 - Aim</h2>
                <p>Crosshair Color: changing your crosshair color to a bright one helps you to see clearly where you are on the map, at all times. Practice aiming from 10-15 minutes a day to get comfortable with how you're aiming. Practice both spamming weapons and weapons that only shoot once. Weapons that spam will require you to track your movement, while weapons that shoot once require you to focus more closely on your object. Always be near cover; a car, a  building, stairs, anything that'll serve as a nice cover from getting shot at. Use higher ground to your advantage; having an upper hand in any shooting game is important, and the opponent can only target a portion of you when they shoot at you, but you can target them all together. Being on higher ground protects you because you're blocked by the surface you're on. (Clips each of my displaying wrongs when trying to get better aim, then the correct way to do it).

                <h2>CLIP #4 - The 3-1 Tactic</h2>
                <p>The 3-1 Tactic will help you a lot when it comes to weapons that are really slow, such as the Hush Puppy, the M-40, and some of the other snipers. All the weapons usually require you to cock them back, and it takes a while and are slow whenever you're in a fight. You can't deal damage quickly enough because the weapons are really slow but what you can do is take the sniper, for example, fire it, then press 3 and then 1 super quickly, which allows you to switch between you gun and knife really quickly. Whenever you go back to the knife and back to the gun the game won't have to play the animation and you can just take another shot right away! It is still delayed by a little bit but it does help you nail a lot of shots a lot faster than usual.

                <h2>CLIP #5 - Knifing </h2>
                <p>Know your hitboxes; a hitbox is essentially where contact and damage can be made. Learning about hitboxing is one of the best to get good or even better at knifing in Arsenal. The best and quickest way to get kills with knifing is by getting your opponent in the back with the knife. Next is positioning and Movement. One of the best ways to practice positioning and movement is to go into hard mode or insane mode. Those modes allow you to run around freely without huge automatic rifles. Last but not least, learn maps and modes. This doesn't apply to just knifing but the game overall. The more you know maps the easier it'd be to kill people, or knife them, because you'd know where they spawn. Knowing the maps will help you get streak kills.
